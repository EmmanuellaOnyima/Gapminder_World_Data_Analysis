# Gapminder World Dataset Analysis
## *By Emmanuella Onyima*

## Dataset
In this explorattion, three datasets were used as indicators to observe trends and growth of different countries, in respect to the selected indicators, over a period of twenty years (2000 - 2019).
These datasets were downloaded from the [Gapminder world website](https://www.gapminder.org/), a website that has collected a lot of information about how people live their lives in different countries, tracked across the years, and on a number of different indicators.

The three indicator datasets includes:

>- **Population**: this is the total population records of each country for each given year.
>- **Female_employment**: this is the percentage of female population, age group 15-24 that has been employed during the given year.
>- **Breast_cancer**: total number of new female cases of breast cancer during the certain year.

## Summary of Findings
From the information obtained in our analysis, the following conclusions can be gathered:

>- **Correlations**: There is a slight positive relationship between breast cancer cases, the total population and the rate of female employments across the 180 countries.

>- **Population and breast cancer rate**: China was seen to have the highest total population of 1,364,500,000 people.

>-**Female employment**: Nepal with a mean total population of 26,430,000 has the highest female employment rate of 74.68%. Libya with the mean total population of 6,094,000 recorded the lowest female employment rate of 3.6485%

>- **Breast cancer rates**: the highest breast cancer cases of 239,100 was recorded in China, and Sao Tome and Principe as the country with the lowest population of 12.45 cases.

## Limitations:

>- There was no direct correlation to indicate the reason for increased or decreased female employment rates across the countries.
>- Lots of uncollected data were observed in the raw datasets leading to unmatched labels after the merge.
>- Inconsistent number of countries in the datasets, lead to the dropping of most indicator data entries.
